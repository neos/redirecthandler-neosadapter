      | Workspace         |
      | user-testaccount  |
    And I move the node into the node with path "/sites/typo3cr/company"
    And I publish the node
    Then I should have a redirect with sourceUri "en/service.html" and targetUri "en/company/service.html"

  @fixtures
  Scenario: Change the the `uriPathSegment` and a redirect will be created
    When I get a node by path "/sites/typo3cr/company" with the following context:

      | user-testaccount |
    And I set the node property "uriPathSegment" to "evil-corp"
    And I publish the node
    Then I should have a redirect with sourceUri "en/company.html" and targetUri "en/evil-corp.html"
